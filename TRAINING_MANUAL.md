## Module 7: Data Quality Best Practices (20 minutes)

### The 5 Rules of Good Data

#### Rule 1: Complete All Required Fields ⭐
```
Red asterisk (*) = Must fill

Before saving, check:
☑ Farmer name entered
☑ Village entered  
☑ Island selected
☑ GPS captured
☑ Farm size entered
☑ At least one crop selected
```

#### Rule 2: Accurate GPS is Critical 📍
```
Good GPS (Use it):
✓ Accuracy: ±5 meters
✓ Status: "Location acquired"
✓ Marker shows on map

Poor GPS (Re-capture):
✗ Accuracy: ±50 meters
✗ Status: "Low accuracy"
✗ Marker in wrong place

Tips:
- Wait 10-15 seconds outdoors
- Move away from buildings/trees
- Check map looks correct
```

#### Rule 3: Consistent Spelling 📝
```
Village Names - Use Official Spelling:
✓ "Port Vila" (not "PortVila" or "Port-Vila")
✓ "Lenakel" (not "Lenakle" or "Lenakell")
✓ "Luganville" (not "Luganvil")

Farmer Names:
✓ Ask: "How do you spell your name?"
✓ Double-check with farmer
✓ Use full name, not nickname
```

#### Rule 4: Realistic Numbers 🔢
```
Farm Size:
✓ 2.5 hectares (reasonable)
✗ 250 hectares (unlikely for small farmer)
✗ 0.01 hectares (too small)

Livestock:
✓ 5 cattle (normal)
✗ 500 cattle (unlikely)
✓ 0 cattle (okay - farmer might have none)

If number seems wrong:
1. Ask farmer again
2. Add note explaining
3. Mark for supervisor review
```

#### Rule 5: Take Clear Photos 📸
```
Photo Checklist:
☑ In focus (not blurry)
☑ Good lighting
☑ Shows what you want to document
☑ Includes scale/context

Examples:
✓ Crop damage with healthy plant for comparison
✓ Farm overview showing layout
✗ Blurry close-up of nothing recognizable
```

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

```
❌ Mistake #1: Not checking GPS before moving
   → Result: Wrong location saved
   → Fix: Always check map marker

❌ Mistake #2: Selecting wrong island from dropdown
   → Result: Statistics wrong
   → Fix: Double-check selection

❌ Mistake #3: Saving incomplete surveys "to finish later"
   → Result: Can't edit after saving
   → Fix: Complete before saving

❌ Mistake #4: Not syncing for multiple days
   → Result: Risk losing data if device breaks
   → Fix: Sync daily

   → Fix: Always ask the pest question
```

## Module 14: Monitoring and Troubleshooting (30 minutes)

### Daily Monitoring Checklist

**Every Morning (10 minutes):**
```
☐ Login to dashboard
☐ Check yesterday's sync activity
☐ Verify expected number of surveys
☐ Review pest/disease alerts
☐ Check for failed syncs
☐ Review user activity
☐ Create backup (if weekly schedule)
```

**Weekly Review (30 minutes):**
```
☐ Export data to Excel
☐ Analyze trends (crops, islands, issues)
☐ Calculate officer productivity
☐ Identify data quality issues
☐ Plan field visit schedules
☐ Report to management
```

---

### Identifying Data Quality Issues

**Red Flags to Watch For:**

#### 1. Suspicious GPS Coordinates
```
Problem: Farm appears in ocean or wrong island

Example:
Farmer: "John Moli"
Island: "Tanna"
GPS: -17.7333°S, 168.3167°E
→ Map shows location on Efate!

Action:
1. Contact officer who collected data
2. Verify correct island
3. Re-visit farm if needed
4. Update survey
```

#### 2. Unrealistic Farm Sizes
```
Problem: Farm size too large or small

Examples:
✗ 0.01 hectares (10m x 10m - too small)
✗ 500 hectares (impossible for smallholder)

Action:
1. Check if decimal point error
2. Contact officer for verification
3. Correct in database
```

#### 3. Missing Required Data
```
Problem: Survey saved without complete data

Check:
- GPS coordinates (0, 0) = not captured
- No crops selected = incomplete
- Farm size = 0 = missing

Action:
1. Flag survey for review
2. Send officer back to farm
3. Update survey
```

#### 4. Duplicate Surveys
```
Problem: Same farmer surveyed multiple times

Indicators:
- Same name + village
- GPS within 50 meters
- Same day or consecutive days

Action:
1. Review both surveys
2. Determine if legitimate (different farms)
3. Merge if duplicate
4. Keep most recent/complete
```

---

### Troubleshooting Dashboard Issues

#### Issue: Dashboard Won't Load
```
Symptoms:
- Blank page

5. Contact IT if persists
```

#### Issue: Map Not Showing
```
Symptoms:

1. Refresh page (F5)
2. Check if Leaflet library loaded
3. Verify GPS data exists
4. Try another browser
5. Wait 5 minutes and retry
```

#### Issue: Charts Not Updating
```
Symptoms:
- Old data shown
- Stats don't match recent syncs

Solutions:
1. Force refresh (Ctrl+F5)
2. Check auto-refresh is enabled
3. Click [Refresh Dashboard] button
4. Clear browser cache
5. Logout and login again
```

#### Issue: Export Fails

### Officer Productivity Analysis

**Calculating Daily Average:**
```
Formula:
Surveys per day = Total surveys / Days active

Example:
Officer John:
- Total surveys: 84
- Days worked: 12
- Average: 84 ÷ 12 = 7 surveys/day
```

**Benchmarks:**
```
Excellent: 10+ surveys/day
Good: 7-9 surveys/day
Acceptable: 5-6 surveys/day
Below target: <5 surveys/day
```

**Factors Affecting Productivity:**
- Remote locations (travel time)
- Difficult terrain
- Weather conditions
- Farmer availability
- New officer (learning)

---
