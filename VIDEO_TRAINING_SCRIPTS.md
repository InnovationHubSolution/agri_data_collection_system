- Export reports for analysis
- Manage users and backups

This is your command center for the entire 
data collection operation. Let's dive in!"

[Transition to screen recording]
```

- Cocoa: 78 farms (32%)

Notice percentages add up to more than 100%?
That's because most farms grow multiple crops."

[Visual: Highlighting bars]

"This data helps you:
- Allocate agricultural extension resources
- Plan crop-specific training programs
- Track trends over time"

[Visual: Moving to Island Distribution chart]

"The Island Distribution chart shows geographic coverage.
Efate has the most surveys at 35%.
This might be because:
- More officers assigned there
- Higher population density
- Better road access

If you see gaps, you can adjust deployment."

[Visual: Highlighting bars, showing percentages]

"Scroll down to the Livestock Totals table."

[Visual: Livestock table]
